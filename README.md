# Viscerion, Code clone of the Unofficial Android client for [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/)


Refreshed take at the official Android client with a nicer UI and additional features. Built with the best of [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/).

## Building

```
$ git clone https://github.com/msfjarvis/viscerion --recursive
$ cd viscerion
$ ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Note: on macOS you might need to install the GNU `coreutils` package through homebrew.
